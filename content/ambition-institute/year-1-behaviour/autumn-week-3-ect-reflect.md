### Reminder of key takeaways

Ms Silva can improve pupil behaviour and learning by understanding that:

- holding and communicating high teacher expectations can improve pupil behaviour
- effective instructions can both prevent problems occurring and reinforce desired behaviours
- delivering effective instructions involves a concise ‘what’ and a clear ‘how’
- checking that pupils understand instructions before letting them start increases the chances of success

### Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
