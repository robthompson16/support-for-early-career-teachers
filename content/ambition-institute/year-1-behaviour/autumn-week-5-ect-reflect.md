### Reminder of key takeaways

Ms Silva can begin to address low-level disruption by understanding that:

- addressing low-level disruption means supporting pupils to meet clear behavioural expectations that ensure the learning environment is effective and that pupils remain on task
- this can be achieved through proactively communicating expectations and reactively reminding pupils in a way which is consistent, proportionate and reinforces wider school expectations
- consistently addressing low-level disruption can improve pupil-teacher relationships and classroom culture

### Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
