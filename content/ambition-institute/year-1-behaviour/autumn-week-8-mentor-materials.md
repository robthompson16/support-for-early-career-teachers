## Structured support of learning

### Select a development area

Consider the development areas for this topic (below). Then make a note of the area you plan to zoom in on and when you plan to visit so you can observe your teacher in this area. Familiarise yourself with the focused development areas. You will select one later when you observe your teacher.

### Development area 1: Using steps

#### Focused development areas

- Teacher breaks down what pupils need to do into sequential steps and uses what they know about pupils’ prior knowledge to make these steps manageable.
- Teacher ensures pupils know the steps they need to take.
- Teacher embeds as a routine a memorable framework for processes they need pupils to use often.

Example precise target: Teacher breaks down what pupils need to do into sequential steps and uses what they know about pupils’ prior knowledge to make these steps manageable.

- **Not doing it at all:** Explain what pupils need to do by breaking it down into steps.
- **Doing it but needs some improvement:** Explain what pupils need to do by breaking it down into steps that are clearly sequenced, e.g. by numbering them.
- **Doing it well and needs some stretch:** Explain what pupils need to do by breaking it down into steps that are manageable given pupils’ prior knowledge and clearly sequence these steps.

### Development area 2: Breaking down models and explanations

#### Focused development areas

- Teacher models aloud a process by breaking it down into sequential, manageable steps based on pupils’ prior knowledge.
- Teacher checks that pupils have understood each part of the model and how it relates to the whole process or concept.
- Teacher breaks down their explanations of concepts into manageable chunks based on pupils’ prior knowledge and checks for understanding at appropriate points.

### Development area 3: Focusing attention

#### Focused development areas

- Teacher ensures they have all pupils’ attention when they model or explain and restates their expectations pre-emptively to help pupils to remain focused.
- Teacher focuses pupils’ attention on the important features of the model or explanation.
- Teacher limits distractions when modelling or explaining through their use of language, resources and instruction.

### Observe

Consider the following questions based on a short (approximately 15 minute) observation of your teacher.

What was your teacher’s previous target? Are they meeting it? How do you know?

Thinking about the development area you have selected for this topic, what is your teacher already doing well in this area? Which focused development area best aligns with what your teacher needs to get better at? What one precise target (bite-sized action) might you work with them on during your mentor meeting?

Reminder: You can choose to stick with this previous target if they have not made enough progress. When moving on to a new precise target, you can select one from the table above or, if this doesn’t fit your teacher’s needs, you can write your own.

How will you model the target to your teacher to show them what good looks like? What questions will you ask to check your teacher understands the model? For example, ‘How it is different from your current practice?’ and ‘What impact might it have on your practice and pupils?’

Reminder: Your model should help your teacher develop their ability in some of the following:

- Break complex material into smaller steps.
- Reduce distractions that take attention away from what is being taught.
- Use modelling, explanations and scaffolds, acknowledging that novices need more structure early in a domain.
- Identify pupils who need new content further broken down.
- Give manageable, specific and sequential instructions.
- Check pupils’ understanding of instructions before a task begins.

Next, meet with your teacher to work through the ‘feedback’ stage of instructional coaching.
