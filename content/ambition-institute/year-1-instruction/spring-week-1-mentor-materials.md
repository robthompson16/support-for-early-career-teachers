## Module overview and re-contracting

### Contracting meeting

Meet with your teacher and use the following prompts as the basis for a coaching contracting discussion. Contracting is most effective when both parties (yourself and the ECT) answer questions for each other.

1. Professional prompts
  - What is important to you in your work?
  - What do you want to get out of this process?
  - What do you need from me to make this work well?

2. Procedural prompts
  - What is the best way for us to communicate and when?
  - When are the best times to meet for our mentor sessions?
  - What classes/subjects are best to observe?

3. Psychological prompts
  - What does an effective professional relationship look like for you? Can you give me an example?
  - What experience have you had of observation? How can we make observation an effective experience?
  - What experiences do you have of coaching? What might we need to do to embrace this coaching approach?

### Context-specific meeting

In addition to contracting, as required, you may wish to meet with your teacher to work through any context-specific policies, systems and/or procedures that they will need to know about to be effective in their role. It is also important for teachers to be made aware of school-specific policies so you may wish to point your NQT to these and provide some time to discuss them.

Typical school policies include, but are not limited to:

- Their responsibilities planning.
- The school’s behaviour policy.
- The safeguarding procedures.
- How your school assesses pupils.
- Your marking requirements.
