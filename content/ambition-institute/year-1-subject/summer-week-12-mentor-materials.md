## Feedback

### Select a development area

Consider the development areas for this topic (below). Then make a note of the area you plan to zoom in on and when you plan to visit so you can observe your teacher in this area. Familiarise yourself with the focused development areas. You will select one later when you observe your teacher.

### Development area 1: Specific feedback that encourages effort

#### Focused development area 

- Teacher provides feedback that is specific and can be actioned by the pupils.
- Teacher provides feedback that can be applied in upcoming tasks. 
- Teacher ensures pupils have time to understand feedback and a means to respond to it.

Example precise target: Teacher provides feedback that is specific and can be actioned by the pupils.


- **Not doing it at all:** Plan feedback that explains to pupils specifically what they are doing well and what they need to do to improve.
- **Doing it but needs some improvement:** Plan feedback that explains to pupils specifically what they are doing well, what they need to do to improve, s accompanied by an actionable task to put this feedback into practice.
- **Doing it well and needs some stretch:** Plan feedback that explains to pupils specifically what they are doing well and what they need to do to improve, accompanied by a task to put this feedback into practice and plan a model of how pupils should action this feedback.

### Development area 2: Efficient feedback

#### Focused development area 

- Teacher uses whole-class or group feedback where possible to address common misconceptions, gaps in knowledge and errors the class are making. 
- Teacher uses verbal feedback or prompts where possible to ensure feedback is timely but not time consuming.

### Development area 3: Feedback and self-monitoring

#### Focused development area 

- Teacher supports pupils to check their work and improve. 
- Teacher uses self and peer assessment thoughtfully and provides support for pupils so that it is effective.                                                                                      

### Observe

Consider the following questions based on a short (approximately 15 minute) observation of your teacher.

- What was your teacher’s previous target? Are they meeting it? How do you know?

- Thinking about the development area you have selected for this topic, what is your teacher already doing well in this area? Which focused development area best aligns with what your teacher needs to get better at? What one precise target (bite-sized action) might you work with them on during your mentor meeting?

Reminder: You can choose to stick with this previous target if they have not made enough progress. When moving on to a new precise target, you can select one from the table above or, if this doesn’t fit your teacher’s needs, you can write your own.

How will you model the target to your teacher to show them what good looks like? What questions will you ask to check your teacher understands the model? For example, ‘How it is different from your current practice?’ and ‘What impact might it have on your practice and pupils?’

Reminder: Your model should help your teacher develop their ability in some of the following:

- Consider carefully whether feeding back or intervening within lessons with individuals and small groups would be more efficient and effective than planning different lessons for different groups of pupils.
- Focus on specific actions for pupils and provide time for pupils to respond to feedback.
- Scaffold self-assessment by sharing model work with pupils, highlighting key details.
- Think carefully about how to ensure feedback is specific and helpful when using peer or self-assessment.
- Use verbal feedback during lessons and in place of written feedback after lessons where possible.

Next, meet with your teacher to work through the ‘feedback’ stage of instructional coaching.
