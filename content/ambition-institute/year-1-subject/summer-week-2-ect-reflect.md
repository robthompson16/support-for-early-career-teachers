### Reminder of key takeaways
Ms Andrews can begin to make a difference to pupils by:
- planning backwards from specific, ambitious goals for knowledge, skills and values: the learning goals set out in the curriculum 
- using her knowledge of the subject and topic and how pupils learn it to break big goals into smaller, more manageable ones and to sequence these goals 
- organising the lesson into a sequence of meaningful steps towards her learning




### Reflect on the following questions
1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms? 
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module? 
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
