### Reminder of key takeaways

Ms Smith can help pupils to acquire and apply ideas by:

- sequencing subject knowledge and concepts and linking them to pupil prior knowledge
- modelling new processes and ideas, linking concrete and abstract models
- checking pupil understanding before encouraging independent practice

### Reflect on the following questions

1. What did you see in this module that you already do or have seen in other classrooms?
2. What do you feel is the gap between your current practice and what you have seen in this module?
3. Which of the ‘key takeaways’ do you need to focus on? Where and when might you try to apply them to your teaching?
