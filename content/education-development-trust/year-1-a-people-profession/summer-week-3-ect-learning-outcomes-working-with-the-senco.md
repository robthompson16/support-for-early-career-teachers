###The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

####Learn that: 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
- Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential. 
- SENCOs, pastoral leaders, careers advisors and other specialist colleagues also have valuable expertise and can ensure that appropriate support is in place for pupils. 

####Learn how to develop an understanding of different pupil needs, by:   
- Working closely with the Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator (SENCO) and special education professionals and the Designated Safeguarding Lead. 
- Using the SEND Code of Practice, which provides additional guidance on supporting pupils with SEND effectively.
