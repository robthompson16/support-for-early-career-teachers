## Avoiding common assessment pitfalls

### Intended outcomes

The intended outcomes of this topic are for Early Career Teachers to:

Learn how to avoid common assessment pitfalls, by:

- Planning formative assessment tasks linked to lesson objectives and thinking ahead about what would indicate understanding (e.g. by using hinge questions to pinpoint knowledge gaps).
- Drawing conclusions about what pupils have learned by looking at patterns of performance over a number of assessments (e.g. appreciating that assessments draw inferences about learning from performance).
- Choosing, where possible, externally validated materials, used in controlled conditions when required to make summative assessments.

### Activities

### Introducing the topic (5 minutes)

ECTs should have brought with them two things to this topic:

- A lesson or sequence of lessons that is going to be taught in the next week
- A selection of marked assessments from one class.

### Planning formative assessment (20 minutes)

Pose the question: what is the purpose of an end of lesson assessment?

Answers might include:

- To provide information to move the learning forwards.
- To give us formative information: what have pupils understood, what has not been understood, what are the misconceptions?
- Not about grading – we need an assessment that will provide feedback to move the learning forward.

Together, look at the sequence of lessons and discuss:

- What is the end of unit assessment?
- What are the skills and knowledge that you will be teaching this term? (If applicable, how might you break these skills/knowledge down further?)
- What are the key skills/concepts that pupils must learn over this sequence of learning in order to be successful in the end of unit assessment?
- In the lesson you will be teaching next, what are the objectives? How do these help build towards the end of unit assessment? What skills/concepts will you be introducing in this lesson?

Example:

Lesson objective: to learn the different uses of apostrophes and be able to apply these.

Pose the question: what are some of the ways we could assess the learning at the end of a lesson?

Answers might include:

- Do now activity. Advantages: useful to identify pupil starting point, useful as a recall tool. Disadvantages: might need a follow-on to secure learning.
- Regular low-stake quizzes. Advantages: identifies what pupils know and can do, low-stakes so supportive of pupils’ needs, helps identify next steps. Disadvantage: potentially time-consuming.
- Exit tickets. Advantages: identifies what pupils know and can do. Disadvantage: timings – if we use these at the end of the lesson it might be too late to re-teach.
- Hinge questions. Advantages: can target misconceptions. Disadvantage: pupils may be able to guess the correct answer.
- Written questions which require short answers. Advantages: more detailed response so pupil understanding can be explored further. Disadvantage: time-consuming to mark.

We need to make sure that our assessment matches the learning objective and that we select the best assessment tool to help us do this.

Non- example:

Lesson objective: to learn the different uses of apostrophes and be able to apply these.
End of lesson assessment: Exit ticket
When should an apostrophe be used?

Pose the question: why is this a non-example?

Answers might include:

- Not closely linked enough to the objective – we won’t get answers to show whether pupils have really understood how to use apostrophes.
- Lacks reliability and validity.
- Lacks structure.
- What you expect of pupils is unclear.

Non-example:

Lesson objective: to learn the different uses of apostrophes and be able to apply these.
End of lesson assessment: Exit ticket.

Tick the following sentences which show apostrophes being used correctly

1. The dog chased it’s tail
2. It’s going to be a lovely, sunny day
3. I would like lot’s of ice cream

Pose the question: what is the issue here?

Answers might include:

- Easy for pupils to guess – not enough items to be a valid assessment.
- Does not ask much of pupils.
- Doesn’t reveal anything about pupil thinking.- Answers do not allow for high-quality feedback.

Example:

Lesson objective: to learn the different uses of apostrophes and be able to apply these.
End of lesson assessment: Exit ticket

Add apostrophes to the following sentences if they are needed:

1. Youre going to love this film
2. Shes always on time
3. Its my favourite flavour
4. My dogs are always hungry
5. The ladies bags

Questions for discussion:

- What makes this example better?
- How does the assessment measure the objective?

Answers might include:

- It will show us which pupils have understood and what they have understood
- This will show us which of the uses of apostrophes pupils have understood
- Which ones they have not understood
- Reliable and valid
- Will highlight misconceptions.

The ECT should plan out an assessment task to measure pupils’ progress towards the lesson objective/s at the end of the lesson.

Pose the question: how will you measure progress throughout the lesson towards meeting this objective?

The ECT should use the following information to help them:

- What will measure pupil progress towards achieving the lesson objective?
- What do I want to know about pupils’ learning?
- What am I going to do with this information?
- What is the best way of finding this out?
- When am I going to find this out?
- When and how am I going to give feedback to pupils?

The ECT should add in detail to their lesson plan around how they will assess progress throughout the lesson.

### Understanding patterns in assessments (20 minutes)

Together, review the set of marked assessments the ECT has recently completed. Use the review document on [Handout 5.2](/assets/materials/edt-Block-5-mentor-handout-5.3.pdf) to help you with this.

What has the review shown the ECT about patterns of performance? What will the ECT take forward into their practice?

### Improving the quality of assessments through using externally validated resources (10 minutes)

Pose the question: how can we ensure that assessments we create are reliable and valid?

Answers might include:

- Refining assessment processes.
- Working with colleagues.
- Reviewing assessments regularly.
- Adding more questions to our assessments.
- Using externally validated sources.

We are going to take a closer look at using externally validated resources.

Pose the question: what are the benefits of using externally validated resources?

Answers might include:

- Ensures assessment is reliable and valid.
- Allows you to measure pupil progress towards learning goals.
- Clear mark scheme to utilise.
- Quality assurance has already taken place.
- Allows you to make judgements about pupil learning.
- Allow you to measure pupil progress towards learning goals.

Mentor to talk the ECT through some of the places they can find externally validated resources. These might include:

- Exam board websites.
- Past papers the department has.
- National databases of questions such as Testbase or Exampro.

### Planning for action

The ECT worked on a lesson today planning in formative assessment opportunities. Identify together when that lesson will be taught and agree that you will come and observe a part of the lesson looking specifically at the formative assessment opportunities.

If the mentor is unable to observe, alternative options are:

- The ECT could record a part of their lesson and share with their mentor
- The ECT could teach the lesson and write down reflections to share with their mentor.
