### Observation focus: Use of assessment to expose misconceptions

#### Possible focus during the observation

- How does the teacher use assessment strategies, such as hinge or multiple-choice questions, to expose misconceptions?
- What does the teacher do after they assess whether there is or is not a misconception?
- What benefits does this bring to the pupils?
- What might you do as a result of this?

### Observation focus: Monitoring pupils’ work during lessons

#### Possible focus during the observation

- What does the teacher do to monitor pupils’ work during the lesson?
- Does the teacher use verbal or written feedback or both?
- How do pupils respond?
- What is the impact of the teacher monitoring during lessons?
- What might you do as a result of this?

### Observation focus: Using a range of questions and the use of wait time

#### Possible focus during the observation

- What different kinds of questions does the teacher use in the lesson, e.g. open, closed, hinge/multiple-choice, follow-on etc.?
- When do different kinds of questions get deployed?
- How involved are the pupils in answering?
- Does the teacher do anything to structure the answering of the question, e.g. using paired discussion before responding?
- How long does the teacher typically wait between asking the question and the answer?
- Could the teacher wait longer in any instances?
- What might you do as a result of this?

### Observation focus: High-quality classroom talk

#### Possible focus during the observation

- What does the teacher do in the lesson to promote talk that is of high quality, e.g. the use of sentence stems, word banks, paired discussion?
- What is the purpose of the classroom talk?
- How do the talk activities support pupil understanding?
- What might you do as a result of this?

### Observation focus: Prompting pupils to elaborate on their responses

#### Possible focus during the observation

- Does the teacher prompt pupils to extend their responses if they are insufficiently detailed?
- How is this done? - What is the effect?
- Does the teacher do anything in advance of asking the question to ensure pupils do elaborate on responses without prompts?
- What might you do as a result of this?

For each observation, write down:

- who you observed
- what happened
- what you have learned from these lesson observations
- what ideas you will carry on using or try out in your practice
