### The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

#### Learn that:

- Teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils.
- Setting clear expectations can help communicate shared values that improve classroom and school culture. - Establishing and reinforcing routines, including through positive reinforcement, can help create an effective learning environment.
- A predictable and secure environment benefits all pupils but is particularly valuable for pupils with special educational needs.

#### Learn how to develop a positive, predictable and safe environment for pupils, by:

- Establishing a supportive and inclusive environment with a predictable system of reward and sanction in the classroom.
- Giving manageable, specific and sequential instructions.
- Checking pupils’ understanding of instructions before a task begins.
- Using consistent language and non-verbal signals for common classroom directions.
- Using early and least-intrusive interventions as an initial response to low level disruption. - Responding quickly to any behaviour or bullying that threatens emotional safety.

#### Learn how to establish effective routines and expectations, by:

- Creating and explicitly teaching routines in line with the school ethos that maximise time for learning (e.g. setting and reinforcing expectations about key transition points).
- Reinforcing routines (e.g. by articulating the link between time on task and success).
