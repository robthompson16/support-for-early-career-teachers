### The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

#### Learn that:

- Prior knowledge plays an important role in how pupils learn; committing some key facts to their long-term memory is likely to help pupils learn more complex ideas
- Where prior knowledge is weak, pupils are more likely to develop misconceptions, particularly if new ideas are introduced too quickly
- Worked examples that take pupils through each step of a new process are also likely to support pupils to learn

#### Learn how to build on pupils’ prior knowledge, by:

- Identifying possible misconceptions and planning how to prevent these forming
- Encouraging pupils to share emerging understanding and points of confusion so that misconceptions can be addressed

### In your notepad

As you work this through activity try to answer the following questions:

- why is it important to take prior knowledge into account?
- what is a misconception?
- how does prior knowledge affect whether pupils develop misconceptions?
- what can teachers do to prevent misconceptions forming if prior knowledge is weak?
