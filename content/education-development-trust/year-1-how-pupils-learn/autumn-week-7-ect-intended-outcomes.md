### The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

#### Learn that

- Learning involves a lasting change in pupils’ capabilities or understanding.                                                                                        - Prior knowledge plays an important role in how pupils learn; committing some key facts to their long-term memory is likely to help pupils learn more complex ideas. 
- An important factor in learning is memory, which can be thought of as comprising two elements: working memory and long-term memory.
- Working memory is where information that is being actively processed is held, but its capacity is limited and can be overloaded.                                    
- Long-term memory can be considered as a store of knowledge that changes as pupils learn by integrating new ideas with existing knowledge.
- Where prior knowledge is weak, pupils are more likely to develop misconceptions, particularly if new ideas are introduced too quickly
- Worked examples that take pupils through each step of a new process are also likely to support pupils to learn.                                                     

#### Learn how to avoid overloading working memory, by:

- Taking into account pupils’ prior knowledge when planning how much new information to introduce.                                                                            
- Breaking complex material into smaller steps (e.g. using partially completed examples to focus pupils on the specific steps).
- Reducing distractions that take attention away from what is being taught (e.g. keeping the complexity of a task to a minimum, so that attention is focused on the content).

#### Build on pupils’ prior knowledge, by:

- Identifying possible misconceptions and planning how to prevent these forming.
- Linking what pupils already know to what is being taught (e.g. explaining how new content builds on what is already known).
- Sequencing lessons so that pupils secure foundational knowledge before encountering more complex content.                                                                   
- Encouraging pupils to share emerging understanding and points of confusion so that misconceptions can be addressed.
