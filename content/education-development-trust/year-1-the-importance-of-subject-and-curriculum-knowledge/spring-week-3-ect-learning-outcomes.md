### The intended outcomes of this activity are for you to:

#### Learn that:
- To access the curriculum, early literacy provides fundamental knowledge; reading comprises two elements: word reading and language comprehension; systematic synthetic phonics is the most effective approach for teaching pupils to decode.
- Every teacher can improve pupils’ literacy, including by explicitly teaching reading, writing and oral language skills specific to individual disciplines.

#### Learn how to develop pupils’ literacy, by:
- Demonstrating a clear understanding of systematic synthetic phonics, particularly if teaching early reading and spelling.
- Supporting younger pupils to become fluent readers and to write fluently and legibly.
