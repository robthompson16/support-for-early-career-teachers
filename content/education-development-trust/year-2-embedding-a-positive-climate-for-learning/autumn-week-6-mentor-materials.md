### Activities

###Reviewing the module (15 minutes)

Using the self-directed study Activity 7.4: ‘Reflecting on learning’, ask the ECT to share their reflections on learning across the module, by asking:

- What approaches to motivating their students (including considerations around high expectations and pupil groupings) have worked well and why?
- Where have there been barriers, and how have they been overcome?
- What further ideas would they like to try?
- How have their classroom practice and approaches to lesson planning developed?

###Identifying next steps (15 minutes)

Work with your ECT to identify their next steps from this module.

- What are your next steps?
- What resources / support do you need?
- When will you do this by?
