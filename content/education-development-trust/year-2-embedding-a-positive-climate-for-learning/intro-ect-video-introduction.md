Video transcript.


  Welcome back! When you started on this programme, you began by looking at how
  to establish a positive learning environment. You learned about how to make
  your classroom a secure, safe and predictable place for your pupils through
  setting up and developing classroom routines, communication of your high
  expectations and building positive relationships. You’ve had a whole year to
  practise these and you will have had many successes. No doubt, there are still
  times when managing behaviour and keeping your expectations really high is
  challenging. That is why we are revisiting it now at the beginning of Year 2,
  just as you will be doing the same with your pupils.



  In this Block, we build on your knowledge by looking at what motivates pupils.
  Understanding ‘what makes them tick’ will help you to develop an even more
  purposeful learning environment. You will explore the different ways you can
  motivate pupils, from using rewards to helping your pupils develop more
  personal motivation. You have already explored the importance of upholding
  high expectations and you will see this is also a key factor in motivation;
  you will explore the link between maintaining high expectations and your
  pupils feeling motivated to work hard and apply effort. You will also consider
  how enabling your pupils to achieve meaningful success can motivate them to
  put in the effort needed for further success.



  We will look further at the importance and value of the language you use with
  pupils, highlighting the ways we can use language to establish an effective
  learning environment and support pupils, empowering them to take ownership of
  their own learning. In Block 1 you explored how you could demonstrate your
  high expectations to your pupils and the impact this would have on pupil
  outcomes. In this Block you will consider how you can use praise meaningfully
  to support and motivate your pupils.
