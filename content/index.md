title: Support for early career teachers
---

The Department for Education has selected 4 expert teacher training providers who have each developed their own accredited materials based on the early career framework.

View the course materials:

- [Ambition Institute](/ambition-institute/)
- [Education Development Trust](/education-development-trust)
- [Teach First](/teach-first)
- [UCL](/ucl)

Each set of materials covers five core areas:

- behaviour management
- pedagogy
- curriculum
- assessment
- professional behaviours

Each set is structured differently, but they all contain approximately the same number of hours of self-study material.
