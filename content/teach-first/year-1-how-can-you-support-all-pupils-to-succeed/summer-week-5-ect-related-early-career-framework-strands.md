### Adaptive teaching

5.2 Seeking to understand pupils’ differences, including their different levels of prior knowledge and potential barriers to learning, is an essential part of teaching.

5.3 Adapting teaching in a responsive way, including by providing targeted support to pupils who are struggling, is likely to increase pupil success.

5.4 Adaptive teaching is less likely to be valuable if it causes the teacher to artificially create distinct tasks for different groups of pupils or to set lower expectations for particular pupils.

5.7 Pupils with special educational needs or disabilities are likely to require additional or adapted support; working closely with colleagues, families and pupils to understand barriers and identify effective strategies is essential.

_5d. Using the SEND Code of Practice, which provides additional guidance on supporting pupils with SEND effectively._

_5e. Adapting lessons, whilst maintaining high expectations for all, so that all pupils have the opportunity to meet expectations._

### Professional behaviours

_8i. Working closely with the SENCO and other professionals supporting pupils with additional needs, making explicit links between interventions delivered outside of lessons with classroom teaching._

_8n. Understanding the right to support (e.g. to deal with misbehaviour)._
