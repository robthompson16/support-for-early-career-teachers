## Observation discussion - using worked or partially completed examples

### Teaching techniques to focus feedback on

### Interaction: 

Observation

### Outcome: 

To have practised using worked or partially completed examples.

### Stimulus

Observe your teacher delivering an explanation using worked or partially completed examples.

### Praise, probe and set precise actions

The following practise should be focused around the outcomes of the probe and precise actions, so that it is specific to your teacher’s developmental needs. However, below are some practise ideas based on the online study content to support you if needed.

### Plan and practice ideas

Your teacher will have explored using worked and partially completed examples in the online study materials and their Early Career Teacher training sessions in week three. Practise either improving the teachers use of worked or partially completed examples or practise creating a worked or partially completed example for a subsequent lesson.

### Key questions and talking points

1. What implications do storage and retrieval practice have for their teaching?
2. How can partially completed examples be used to reduce distractions and keep the attention focused on key learning points?
