## Introduction

In this module you will explore the findings and evidence gathered during studies of how pupils learn, and the related implications for teaching.

You will hear from Deans for Impact, an American not-for-profit organisation set up with the aim of improving teacher education. A summary of their work on How Pupils Learn can be found in the publication ‘[The Science of Learning](https://deansforimpact.org/resources/the-science-of-learning/)’, which will be referenced throughout the module.

You will explore the importance of memory in learning; how to build and sequence your pupils’ long-term memory into organised mental models to support learning; and how to avoid overwhelming pupils when introducing new concepts and knowledge.

While engaging with this online content, you will also prepare for discussions with your mentor and training sessions led by your school.
