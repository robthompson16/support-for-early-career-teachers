## Discussion - deciding topic for scheme of work and where to go for expert guidance

### Practice focus

### Interaction:

Discussion

### Outcomes:

- To have made a final decision on a topic for the scheme of work your teacher will design throughout this module.
- To have offered guidance on where and who your teacher can go to for high-quality resources.

Your teacher will bring to this session ideas about what topic they’d like to design a scheme of work on. Ideally this will be a scheme of work they will teach to pupils. Given we’re already in the summer term, it might make sense for them to design a scheme of work they will teach next academic year.

### Key questions and talking points

1. Recap the outcome of this module: to design a scheme of work.
2. Which schemes of work that you have taught have you found most helpful/supportive? Why?
