## Discussion - developing the teacher input, guided practice and independent practice across a scheme of work

### Practice focus

### Interaction:

Discussion

### Outcome:

- To have developed the teacher input, guided practice and independent practice across a scheme of work

And/or

- To have developed the interleaving of concrete examples and non-examples into a scheme of work

### Stimulus

In the online study materials, your teacher was asked to review their scheme of work, considering the questions below:

- With a focus on your learning objectives, where do you need to build in time for teacher input, guided practice and independent practice?
- Where would it be helpful to interleave concrete examples and non-examples to support pupils’ understanding of an abstract concept?

They were asked to prepare to share their evolving scheme of work with you.

Review and discuss their scheme of work.

### Praise, probe and set precise actions

The following practise should be focused around the outcomes of the probe and precise actions, so that it is specific to your teacher’s developmental needs. However, below are some practise ideas based on the online study content to support you if needed.

### Plan and practice ideas

Practise either:

- Building in time for teacher input, guided practice and independent practice across the scheme of work
- Interleaving concrete examples and non-examples across the scheme of work

### Key questions and talking points

1. Where and why have you built in time for teacher input, guided practice and independent practice?
2. What are pupils practising and why?
3. Is there enough space for pupils to be guided in their practice before working independently?
4. Where and why have you interleaved concrete examples and non-examples?
5. (_If appropriate to the scheme of work_) What are the abstract concept(s) you want pupils to understand?
