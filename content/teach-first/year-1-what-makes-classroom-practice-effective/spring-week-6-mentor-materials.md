Observation

To have planned and practised effective questioning to extend and challenge pupils.

### Stimulus

- Check whole class understanding  
- Provide appropriate wait time after asking a question to allow pupils to generate a response 
- Not complete pupils’ answers 
- Ask follow-up questions to extend and challenge pupils 
- Provide scaffolds for pupil talk to increase the focus and rigour of dialogue
