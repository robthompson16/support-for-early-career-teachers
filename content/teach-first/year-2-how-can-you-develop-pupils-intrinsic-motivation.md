## Weeks 4, 5 and 6

### ECTs

You’ll: 

- continue to integrate new learning into your teaching

### Mentors

Carry out a lesson observation with a specific focus on how the ECT has integrated new learning into their practice. Consider how the identified area of focus has been applied. 

Arrange a discussion with your ECT and use the instructional coaching model to provide feedback: praise, probe, set precise actions, plan, practise. 

Look ahead to the next half term’s training materials and areas of focus. 

Duration: 80 minutes.
