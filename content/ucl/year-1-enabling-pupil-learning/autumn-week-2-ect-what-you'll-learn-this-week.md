You will learn that:

- teachers have the ability to affect and improve the wellbeing, motivation and behaviour of their pupils
- teachers are key role models, who can influence the attitudes, values and behaviours of their pupils
- teacher expectations can affect pupil outcomes; setting goals that challenge and stretch pupils is essential
- a culture of mutual trust and respect supports effective relationships
- establishing and reinforcing routines, including through positive reinforcement, can help create an effective learning environment
- a predictable and secure environment benefits all pupils, but is particularly valuable for pupils with special educational needs

You will learn how to demonstrate consistently high behavioural expectations by:

- creating a culture of respect and trust in the classroom that supports all pupils to succeed. For example, by modelling the types of courteous behaviour expected of pupils

You will learn how to establish effective routines and expectations by:

- creating and explicitly teaching routines in line with the school ethos that maximise time for learning. For example, setting and reinforcing expectations about key transition points
- practising routines at the beginning of the school year
- reinforcing routines. For example, by articulating the link between time on task and success
