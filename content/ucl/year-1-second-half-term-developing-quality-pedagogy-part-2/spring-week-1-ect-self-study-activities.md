### Review: 10 mins

Read the Research and Practice Summary on this week’s topic. As you read, reflect on:

1. the practices that you are already doing well
2. the practices you are doing some of the time, but could do more of/more consistently
3. the practices you don’t use in your teaching yet

As you work through the activities in this week’s self-directed study session and mentor meeting, aim to both refine and extend what you already do well, and to build your skill and confidence in using practices which are not yet a regular part of your teaching repertoire.

### Plan: 10 mins

#### Self-assessment

Which aspects of the research and practice summary – or of the example of Molly’s geography teacher – are most relevant to the challenges you are experiencing in your teaching at the moment?

Note in your Learning Log the two or three key messages you are taking away for your own teaching. For example, what insights has it given you for how you support pupils with specific needs through:

- how you group your class
- what you know about the different levels of support they need
- understanding their barriers to learning
- how you guide them in group and paired activities
- liaising with colleagues and families
- adapting your practice without creating separate tasks

### Theory to Practice: 20 mins

#### 1. Practical exercise

Focus on a specific group of pupils or a class. Below are a set of ‘challenges’, for which you have to plan your practical response. You may want to dwell on some more than others. Some hints are given.

####Challenge: What are the potential barriers to effective collaboration in your classroom?

#####Hint:
A learning need, behaviour, family, socio-economic?

####Challenge: What specific guidance and support will you need to provide your pupils to ensure effective group work takes place?

#####Hint:
Assign roles to your pupils or issue strict protocols

####Challenge: How can you monitor the impact of your groupings on the engagement and motivation of pupils with specific educational needs?

#####Hint:
Monitor the engagement and motivation of a smaller group of pupils

####Challenge: Can you build flexibility into your attainment groupings to avoid a fixed mindset being established?

#####Hint:
Experiment with different types of within-class groupings, such as by near prior attainment, or by mixed prior attainment

####Challenge: How will you adapt your teaching for those pupils who are learning at a different rate to others?

#####Hint:
Vary the attention you give to different pupils, the time you allow, the quantity you expect

### Next Steps: 5 mins

Complete this practical activity, ready for your next mentor meeting. Think about any questions you may have for your mentor in relation to using groupings to support pupils with specific needs.
